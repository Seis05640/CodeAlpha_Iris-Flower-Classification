# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification Project

This project uses the classic **Iris dataset** to build a simple **machine learning classifier** that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its physical measurements. It was completed as part of my **Data Science Internship at CodeAlpha**.

---

## ✅ Project Highlights

- **Dataset:** Iris flower measurements (`sepal length`, `sepal width`, `petal length`, `petal width`).
- **Task:** Classify flowers into **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica**.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
- **Model:** Decision Tree Classifier.
- **Visualization:** Decision boundary plot for petal length vs petal width.
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
